# LightningMathFacts

The logic behind this program is aligned with many hours of one-on-one experience teaching kids math facts. 

Thought the user interface is just a console app, the rather sophisticated algorithms behind it make for a pleasant and encouraging user experience. 

My daughter highly disliked the computer-based system for math facts at her last school, but kept asking to play this one just for fun!
